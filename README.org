* Additional configuration to be set in koha-conf.xml

  Currently our configuration accepts 6 additional parameters from
  koha-conf.xml:
  - <api_key>
  - <api_key_auth>
  - <api_application>
  - <api_application_auth>
  - <api_url>
  - <is_outside_uk>
  Normally only <api_application> and <api_application_auth> need to
  be set.  <api_url> defaults to the test environment, so it should be
  set when switching to production, to "https://api.bldss.bl.uk".
  <is_outside_uk> should be set according to whether the request is being made
  from an institution outside the UK. If not, an additional flag is sent to
  the BLDSS API request: <payCopyright>true</payCopyright>. If this flag is
  not present in the config, we will assume the institution is inside the UK
